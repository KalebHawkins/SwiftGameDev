It leverages Metal to achieve high-performance rendering while offering a simple programming interface to make it easy to create games and other graphics-intensive apps. Using a rich set of animations and physics behaviors, you can quickly add life to your visual elements and gracefully transition between screens. Quick Word Welcome to the first step in beginning your iOS game development journey. I hope this will be as much a learning experience for anyone reading this as it will be for myself. I will assume that you have some prior experience with iOS development. Below are some highly recommended references if you don't have previous experience. Course Description Angela Yu's Udemy Course One of the best places to start learning iOS development. The course stays updated, is of high quality, and the teaching style is at a pace that anyone could keep up. Stanford University CS193p 2017-2018 This is an excellent resource to learn iOS development. Stanford University CS193p 2020 This is a faster-paced course but covers things in great detail. The course focuses on SwiftUI. Hacking With Swift Search anything involving Swift HackingWithSwift will appear. The content is high quality. Ray Wenderlinch A site much like HackingWithSwift. There is high-quality content here. Do not try to consume everything from every link listed above. Doing so will burn anyone out with little to no progress. The best thing to do is learn concepts and then put those concepts to practice. Your First Project This first project will be something simple. The goal is to draw a scene and a shape. We are going to create a Single View App then add Spritekit to it. The process for adding Spritekit to a project is described in Apple's Developer Documentation but is difficult to follow. I recommend you read the page linked after this tutorial and try to understand it. Get Xcode The first thing to do is ensure you have Xcode downloaded and installed. Creating the Project Now let's create a project. You can follow the gif below to see how to do that. The steps are as follows: 1. Open Xcode 2. Create a new project 3. Select IOS 4. Select App 5. Fill out the required fields Product Name: WhateverYouWant Team: WhatEverYouWant Organizational Identifier: com.whateverYouWant Interface: Storyboard Lifecycle: UIKit App Delegate Language: Swift The SKView Class In Apple's documentation, they walk you through creating a Scene, drawing a node, and finally presenting the scene. They don't explain setting up the View that you present. The View needs to be of class SKView . Setup SKView There are two ways to set the View as a SKView . The first is to go to your Main.Storyboard file and select the main View and change its class to SKView as seen in the images below. You can set the View programmatically as well. I don't recommend the programmatic approach because I've run into bugs with it. To The Code Navigate to the ViewController.swift file you will see code very similar to the following: import UIKit class ViewController: UIViewController { override func viewDidLoad() { super.viewDidLoad() // Do any additional setup after loading the view. } } Integrating Spritekit The first thing to do is integrate Spritekit into our project. Using the import Spritekit statement import the framework into the project. import UIKit // Import Spritekit here import Spritekit class ViewController: UIViewController { //... } Creating the Scene As explained in Apple's Developer Documentation: \"Everything displayed with SpriteKit is done through a scene object, which is an instance of SKScene .\" To set up a SKScene use the following code. import UIKit import Spritekit class ViewController: UIViewController { override func viewDidLoad() { super.viewDidLoad() // Check the view to ensure it is of type SKView if let skView = view as? SKView { // Initialize a SKScene object. By passing the size of the view's bounds the scene will fit to the screen. let scene = SKScene(size: skView.bounds.size) // Present the scene skView.presentScene(scene) } } } Adding a Node Compile and run your code using Cmd + R . You should see an empty grey screen. Ready to add something to the scene? Using SKShapeNode create a circle using the following code. import UIKit import SpriteKit class ViewController: UIViewController { override func viewDidLoad() { super.viewDidLoad() if let skView = view as? SKView { let scene = SKScene(size: skView.bounds.size) // Set the scene's anchor point to the center of the screen. scene.anchorPoint = CGPoint(x: 0.5, y: 0.5) // Create an SKShapeNode with a circleOfRadius of 25 let roundThing = SKShapeNode(circleOfRadius: 25) // Set the fill color of the SKShapeNode to red roundThing.fillColor = .red // Add the SKShapeNode to the scene. scene.addChild(roundThing) skView.presentScene(scene) } } } Congratulations You have completed the first project. You have something to show! Getting this far takes a lot of work. You are already miles ahead of anyone else that said \" I want to make games \" and never put in the effort. Here are some exercises I recommend trying. Remember, documentation and Google are tools. Utilize them. There is no shame in it. It is counterproductive to bang your head against a wall figuring out how to do something when you can look it up in seconds. The references will help guide you through the exercises.

A scene is the root node in a tree of Spritekit nodes ( SKNodes ). The nodes provide content that the scene animates and renders for display. SKScene is a subclass of SKEffectNode and enables certain effect to apply to the entire scene. Enabling effects across an entire scene may be an expensive operation so use this cautiously. Creating a Scene File In the last tutorial a SKScene was created programmatically. This time the SKScene will be created from an .sks scene file. Step 1. Start by creating a new Single App View project as done in the previous tutorial. Step 2. Set the UIView to use the SKView class in the Main.Storyboard file. Step 3. Import Spritekit into your project using the import Spritekit statement within the ViewController.swift file. import UIKit import Spritekit //... To create a .sks scene file press Cmd + N enter scene in the filter and select Spritekit Scene . Careful not to select Scenekit Scene . This will put you in Xcode's scene editor. This is where base scene configuration should take place when possible. Modifying the Scene It is faster to edit the base scene from the editor and it cuts down on code pollution in the source files. Take some time to explore the editor. Get a feel for what you can do with your scene. For example changing the background color can be done by clicking the Attributes Inspector and selecting the color your the color attributes. Linking the Scene Now to link the file up to the code. Navigate back to the ViewController.swift file and use the following code. import UIKit import SpriteKit class ViewController: UIViewController { override func viewDidLoad() { super.viewDidLoad() if let skView = view as? SKView { // Use the SKScene(fileName:) function to load the scene. // The string \"MyScene\" comes from the name of the sks file. // So if the name of the file was Level01.sks you would replace \"MyScene\" with \"Level01\" let scene = SKScene(fileNamed: \"MyScene\") // Present the scene skView.presentScene(scene) } } } The code above looks almost identical to the code in the previous tutorial. The exception is the SKScene function is initialized with the filename of the .sks file. Hitting the Cmd + R keys will compile and run your code. This time the background should be the same color chosen from the attributes tab in the .sks file. It may take a few seconds to load up the first time it is ran so be patient. It should not take longer the a minute. Adding Sprite's to the Scene You can can sprites and nodes to the scene using the editor as well. Back in the .sks file click the + button in the upper right hand corner of the scene editor. Watch the above animation carefully and notice that when the Circle Sprite is placed it has a square shape. The reason for this is explained in a later tutorial. Notice also that the context of the attributes editor changes when selecting a node. This allows for different aspects of the node to be modified. The Scene's Node Tree When building the scene you want to keep nodes organized in larger projects. The editor allows you to visualize your nodes in a tree-like structure. Nodes can be nested and organized. When a node is nested below another node it becomes a child or it's parent node. Things like inheritance for certain attributes take place unless overridden by the child node. These are important concepts to keep in mind. Congratulations You made it through another tutorial. I hope you have a good understanding of SKScenes and how to change a scene's attribute, add nodes, and change attributes of those nodes. There are many things you can do with the SKScene object: Stretch the Content to Fit the View Configure the ViewPort (Define what part of the scene is visible at a given time) Respond to loading and resizing events Respond to Frame-Cycle events Delegating a scene Change background appearance Configure Physics Add positional audio Note that a SKScene inherits from the SKEffectNode . That means anything that can be done with the SKEffectNode can be performed on a SKScene . These action can include: Apply Core Image Filters Warping Nodes Applying Shaders Flatten Node Tree's for improved performance Configure Alpha blending In the next tutorial we will be adding some movement to a SKShapeNode . Exercises These exercises may seem a bit dull but they are beneficial. Don't try to memorize everything. The documentation is there for a reference when needed. Do put what you learn to practice while learning it. This will re-enforce the concepts. The same principle applies for learning any skill.
